# Objective
The main objective is to score more points than your opponent. Strategically move your pieces to capture your opponent's pieces, capture gems, and prevent your opponent from capturing your pieces and scoring gems!

# Gameplay
The game ends when EITHER one of two things happen:
1. 100 turns are played - each player gets 50 turns.
2. A player scores the red gem. This immediately ends the game.

# Movement
- Circles and Clovers can move up, down, left, or right.


- Triangles and Stars can move diagonally.


- Circles and Triangles can only move one space at a time.


- Clovers and Stars can move up to 3 spaces in only one direction at a time. Direction chaining isn't allowed. As an example, a Clover can't move up, then left, then up again in the same turn. All movement in any given turn must be in the same direction. 


- Clovers and Stars may move past gems without capturing them, but they may not move past other pieces.


- Gems cannot move on their own. They must be carried by another piece to move. To pick up a gem, a piece must move to the same space as it. 


- Additionally, a gem can be "passed" from one piece to another friendly piece within a two-tile radius in all directions. Doing this ends your turn. 


- If a piece is already holding a gem, it cannot pick another gem.


- A player may capture an opponent's pieces by moving to the same space as the other piece. If a piece is holding a gem, it cannot capture other pieces. If a piece is captured while holding a gem, the piece that captured the other piece gains possession of the gem.
